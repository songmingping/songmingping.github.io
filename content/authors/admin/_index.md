I am a senior Information and Computing Science student at University of Liverpool/Xi 'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, specializing in the realms of Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality. At the X-CHI Lab, my research is centered around human-computer interactive devices, reinforcing learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, interactive technologies, digital twins, and automated systems.

My academic endeavors focus on integrating these advanced technological concepts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of human-computer interactions. Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between complex computational theories and practical, user-friendly applications.

Research Skills: Propose questions, Literature review,Design and conduct experiments, Data analysis, Paper Writing, Editvideo and poster. Establish mathematical model

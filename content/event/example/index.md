summary: As a senior student in Information and Computing Science, I had the privilege of serving as a volunteer at the ISMAR 2023 Conference. My contributions included setting up and managing the online conference platforms and engaging in academic dialogues with professors and researchers in the field of mixed and augmented reality.
abstract: During my time at ISMAR 2023, I played an integral role in the technical aspects of the conference, particularly in setting up and maintaining the online platforms for virtual participation. This task was not only crucial for the seamless execution of the conference but also allowed me to gain hands-on experience with the latest digital communication tools and technologies. Additionally, I had the opportunity to engage in academic discussions with experts in the field, which enriched my understanding of current trends and advancements in mixed and augmented reality. These interactions have been immensely beneficial for my academic growth and professional network.
